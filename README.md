## OVERVIEW

mdserver reads a directory tree and picks out all files that are markdown documents.
These are then presented as filenames to user via browser.
When clicked, the file is run through the markdown process and shown to user.


### Installation

If you have a working go installation on a Unix-like OS:

> ```go get github.com/hotei/mdserver```

Will copy github.com/hotei/mdserver to the first entry of your $GOPATH

or if go is not installed yet :

> ```cd DestinationDirectory```

> ```git clone https://github.com/hotei/mdserver.git```

### Configuration

* You can/should change the directory where the search for markdown docs begins.

### Features

* Serves files with the following extensions
 * .md
 * .mdown
 * .markdown
* Standalone webserver executable is medium sized (for go)
	* go 1.4.2 file is about 6.5 MB 
	* go 1.5rc1 file is about 8.2 MB
* you can supply a list of dirs if you want to exclude them from processing
* IP and port number served is set by flag - default is 8281 (a random pick)
* can be run at "localhost" if appropriate (more secure, but can't be used from other computers)
* refreshes list every 5 minutes (flag setable) 

### Limitations

* <font color="red">If used in forensic environment you may need to adjust file permissions of the markdown files to allow the server to read all files.</font>

### Usage

Typical usage is :

```mdserver &```

### Bugs

None Known

### To-Do

* Essential:
 * TBD
* Nice:
 * use fsnotify to refresh list only when something changes


### Change Log
* 2015-06-20 minor update pushed
	* skipDirs implemented
	* suppress generic duplicated README.md 
* 2015-04-30 revisited for go 1.4.2 update
* 2014-03-25 Working
* 2014-03-25 Started
